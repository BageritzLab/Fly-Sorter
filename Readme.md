This is the hand-held Fly Sorter which increases the speed with which *Drosophila* flies can be sorted (e.g. into male and female or by phenotype).

There are two versions of the Fly Sorter:
1. A Quick build that can be made using basic components that can be used with 50 ml Falcon tubes.
2. A 3D printable version that can be used for 50 ml Falcon tubes and standard Laboratpry Fly Vials

Please see the [Building Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15dwhqNPN-IYihsDtu09y4-i83bKWOhseYIVJSIRqwcc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.

In our Tests flies that have been sorted 7 consecutive times have not displayed any adverse effects.
